/*
I implemented this with the idea that I only need to go up to the sqrt of 
the number to find 1 number in a pair that is a factor of n
e.g: if n = 15 the factors are 1,3,5,15. All we need to do is check 1,3 since
15/1 = 15 and 15/3 = 5. Thus we only need the lower half of the sqrt(15), which is
approx 3.9 which becomes 3 since we are working with int types.

    // and check the number we are at and value/number (to see if the other pair is prime as well)
    // the reason is cause we want to check all pairs of the numbers
    // e.g. for 15 we want to see if 1,3,5,15 if any of them is prime

    //we begin at larger number to find the largest faster, in reality if properly implemented above

// Answer: 6857

// Time Complexity = O(sqrt(n)*sqrt(m)) = n is all numbers we go through, and m is number we checking if prime, so finding all divisible numbers
// Space Complexity = O(1)

// Can get a time complexity of O(nlog log(n)) by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
// not sure if this is worth implementing. as space is O(n) as well
